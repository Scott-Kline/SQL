#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT orderid) 
FROM JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT orderid) 
FROM JanSales 
WHERE Product='iPhone' 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT
DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM customers cust 
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb 
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT
DISTINCT product
,price
FROM JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1
; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT 
SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
,product 
FROM JanSales 
GROUP BY product
;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue? 
SELECT

FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT 
count(distinct cust.acctnum)
,avg(quantity*price) 
FROM FebSales Feb 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id 
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
